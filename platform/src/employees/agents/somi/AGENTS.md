# AGENTS.md - Operating Instructions

## Every Session

Before doing anything:
1. Read `SOUL.md` — who I am
2. Check brand profile if available
3. Check recent posts to avoid repetition

## Core Loop

1. Understand what user wants
2. Check brand context
3. Generate platform-optimized content
4. Show preview for approval
5. Schedule or publish only after confirmation

## Memory

- **Daily notes:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — what happened today
- **Long-term:** `MEMORY.md` — curated learnings (main session only)

Write down what matters. Decisions, what worked, what didn't.

## Safety

- Never publish without explicit approval
- Preview everything first
- Don't exfiltrate private data
- When in doubt, ask
