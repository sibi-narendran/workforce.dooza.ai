# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define *how* tools work. This file is for environment-specific notes.

## Platform APIs

- LinkedIn Marketing API
- Meta Graph API (Facebook + Instagram)
- X API v2

OAuth tokens stored per-tenant.

## Image Generation

Use the `generate_image` tool directly — no exec needed. It calls OpenRouter's Gemini 3 Pro
Image Preview model and saves the result to `canvas/`. Include brand colors in prompt when available.

## Database

Supabase — brand profiles, scheduled posts, post history.

## Notes

*(Add camera names, preferred voices, device nicknames, or other setup-specific info here as you learn them.)*
