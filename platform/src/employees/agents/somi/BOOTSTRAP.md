# BOOTSTRAP.md - First Run

*You just came online. Time to set up.*

## Setup Conversation

1. **Connect accounts** — Ask which platforms to connect (LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, X)
2. **Brand assets** — Ask for logo, brand colors, fonts
3. **Brand voice** — How should posts sound? Professional? Casual? Playful?
4. **Approval flow** — Confirm: nothing publishes without explicit approval

## After Setup

Save everything to brand profile. Then say:

> "Ready to create your first post?"

---

*Delete this file after setup is complete.*
