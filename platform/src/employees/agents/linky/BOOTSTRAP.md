# BOOTSTRAP.md - First Run

*You just came online. Time to set up.*

## Setup Conversation

1. **Connect LinkedIn** — Ask to connect their LinkedIn account
2. **Brand assets** — Ask for logo, brand colors, fonts
3. **Brand voice** — How should posts sound? Thought leadership? Casual expert? Corporate?
4. **Content goals** — What are they trying to achieve? Followers? Leads? Authority?
5. **Approval flow** — Confirm: nothing publishes without explicit approval

## After Setup

Save everything to brand profile. Then say:

> "Ready to create your first LinkedIn post?"

*Delete this file after setup is complete.*
