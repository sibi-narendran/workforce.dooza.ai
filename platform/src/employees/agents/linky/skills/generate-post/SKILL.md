# generate-post

Create engaging, LinkedIn-optimized professional posts.

## When to Use

User asks to create, draft, write, or generate a post, article intro, or LinkedIn content.

## Before Generating

1. **Check `MEMORY.md`** for brand voice, tone preferences, past learnings
2. **Check recent posts** in `memory/` to avoid repetition
3. **Ask if unclear:** what topic? what angle? thought leadership, story, or tactical?

## LinkedIn Rules

- **Character limit:** 3,000 (first 210 visible before "see more")
- **Tone:** Professional but human — thought leadership, insights, stories
- **Hook:** First line must stop the scroll — bold claim, question, surprising stat, or counterintuitive take
- **Hashtags:** 3–5 max, at the end
- **Line breaks:** Use single-line sentences with blank lines between for readability
- **No emojis overload** — 1–2 per post max, used intentionally
- **No engagement bait** — no "agree?" or "repost if you think..."

## Post Types

### Thought Leadership
- Share an insight or strong opinion
- Back it with experience or data
- Invite discussion

### Story Posts
- Personal or professional narrative
- Lesson at the end
- Relatable, human, specific

### Tactical / How-To
- Frameworks, tips, step-by-step
- Actionable and specific
- Easy to save and share

### Contrarian Takes
- Challenge conventional wisdom
- Explain why the common view is wrong
- Offer a better alternative

## Post Structure

Every post follows this framework:

```
1. HOOK      — Stop the scroll (question, bold take, surprising stat)
2. BODY      — Deliver value (story, insight, list, framework)
3. CTA       — Drive action (comment, share, save)
4. HASHTAGS  — 3–5 relevant tags
```

### LinkedIn Template
```
[Hook — bold first line that makes people stop scrolling]

[2–4 short paragraphs with line breaks between each]

[CTA — question or invitation to engage]

#hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3
```

## Output Format

Always present the draft like this:

```

#️⃣ Hashtags: [count]

- 📅 Save to calendar?
- 🎨 Generate an image for it?
```

## Algorithm Tips

- Posts with comments in the first hour get 2–3x reach
- Questions at the end drive comments
- Native text posts often outperform link posts
- Carousels and documents get high dwell time
- Posting Tue–Thu 8–10am gets highest engagement
- First line determines whether people click "see more"

## Brand Voice

Before writing, check if the user has established brand preferences:
- **Tone:** formal, casual, witty, authoritative?
- **Vocabulary:** industry jargon OK or plain language?
- **Perspective:** first person (I/we) or third person?
- **Topics to avoid:** anything off-brand?

If brand context exists in `MEMORY.md`, follow it. If not, ask on the first post and remember the answers.

## Examples

**User:** "Write a post about AI in hiring"

**Draft:**
```

Most companies say they want to hire the best talent.

Then they screen resumes with a keyword filter from 2010.

AI isn't replacing recruiters — it's replacing bad processes.

The companies getting hiring right are using AI to:
→ Surface non-obvious candidates
→ Reduce time-to-hire by 40%
→ Remove unconscious bias from screening

The ones getting it wrong? Automating the same broken system faster.

The tool doesn't matter. The thinking behind it does.

What's one hiring practice you think AI should fix first?
