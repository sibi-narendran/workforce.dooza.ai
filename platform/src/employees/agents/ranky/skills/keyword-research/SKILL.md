# keyword-research

Research keywords for SEO targeting based on the user's business, industry, and goals.

## When to Use

User asks to find keywords, research search terms, identify opportunities, or plan content topics.

## Before Researching

1. **Check `MEMORY.md`** for existing keyword targets and strategy
2. **Check brand profile** for industry, audience, website
3. **Ask if unclear:** what topic? what intent? what stage of funnel?

## Process

1. **Understand the seed topic** or page to optimize
2. **Use `keyword_suggestions`** to get real keyword ideas from Google Autocomplete
3. **Use `keyword_info`** on promising keywords to get search volume, difficulty, CPC, and intent
4. **Identify search intent** — informational, navigational, transactional, commercial
5. **Generate keyword clusters** — primary, secondary, long-tail, related
6. **Prioritize** — balance volume, difficulty, and relevance using real data

## Output Format

| Keyword | Intent | Est. Difficulty | Priority |
|---------|--------|-----------------|----------|
| [keyword] | [informational/transactional/etc.] | [Low/Med/High] | [P1/P2/P3] |

### Keyword Clusters

Group related keywords into topic clusters for content planning.

## Tips

- Focus on long-tail keywords for new/small sites
- Match intent — don't target informational keywords for product pages
- Look for question-based keywords (how, what, why, best, vs)
- Consider local modifiers if relevant
- Always tie keywords back to business goals
