# content-optimization

Analyze existing content and provide actionable SEO optimization recommendations.

## When to Use

User asks to optimize content, improve SEO, review a page, audit an article, or check SEO quality.

## Process

1. **Read the content** provided by the user
2. **Check target keyword** — ask if not provided
3. **Analyze on-page factors:**
   - Title tag (50-60 chars, keyword near front)
   - Meta description (150-160 chars, compelling, keyword included)
   - H1 tag (unique, includes primary keyword)
   - H2-H6 hierarchy (logical structure, keyword variations)
   - Keyword density (natural, not stuffed — aim for 1-2%)
   - Internal linking opportunities
   - Image alt text
   - Content length vs. competitors
   - Readability (short paragraphs, bullet points, clear language)
   - E-E-A-T signals (experience, expertise, authority, trust)
4. **Score and prioritize** recommendations
