2. **Industry & competitors** — Who are the top 3 competitors?
3. **Current SEO status** — Any existing keyword targets? Google Search Console access?
4. **Goals** — More traffic? Better rankings for specific terms? Local SEO?
5. **Content strategy** — Do they publish blog posts? How often?

## After Setup
