# generate-post

Create engaging, YouTube-optimized video content plans — titles, descriptions, tags, and concepts.

## When to Use

User asks to create, draft, write, plan, or generate a YouTube video, title, description, or content plan.

## Before Generating

1. **Check `MEMORY.md`** for brand voice, tone preferences, past learnings
2. **Check recent posts** in `memory/` to avoid repetition
3. **Ask if unclear:** what topic? what style? tutorial, vlog, review, short?

## YouTube Content Types

### Long-form Video
- **Title:** 50-60 chars, front-load keywords, curiosity gap
- **Description:** 5,000 char limit — first 2-3 lines most important (above fold)
- **Tags:** Mix of broad + specific, include channel name, 500 char total
- **Hook:** First 30 seconds of video concept — what grabs attention

### YouTube Shorts
- **Title:** Under 40 chars — punchy, immediate
- **Description:** Brief — 1-2 sentences + hashtags
- **Format:** Vertical, under 60 seconds, fast-paced
- **Hook:** First 2 seconds must hook — no intro, jump straight in

## Video Plan Structure

Every video plan follows this framework:

```
1. TITLE      — SEO-optimized, curiosity-driven
2. HOOK       — First 30 seconds concept (what stops the scroll)
3. DESCRIPTION — Full video description with timestamps
4. TAGS       — 15-20 relevant tags
5. THUMBNAIL  — Concept for thumbnail design
6. CTA        — End screen / subscribe prompt
```

### Long-form Template
```
TITLE: [50-60 char title with keyword front-loaded]

HOOK (first 30 sec):
[What happens in the opening to keep viewers watching]

DESCRIPTION:
[2-3 compelling lines above the fold]

[Timestamps]
0:00 - [Section]
2:15 - [Section]
...

[Links, social, etc.]

TAGS:
[tag1], [tag2], [tag3], ... (15-20 tags)

THUMBNAIL CONCEPT:
[Description of ideal thumbnail — expression, text overlay, colors]

CTA:
[Subscribe prompt / end screen concept]
```

### Shorts Template
```
TITLE: [Under 40 chars — punchy]

HOOK (first 2 sec):
[Immediate grab — question, shocking statement, visual]

DESCRIPTION:
[1-2 lines] #shorts #[topic] #[niche]

CONCEPT:
[What happens in the short — beginning to end]
```

## Output Format

Always present the draft like this:

```

## SEO Tips

- **Search intent:** Match what people actually type into YouTube search
- **Keywords:** Put primary keyword in title, description first line, and first tag
- **Competitors:** Think about what similar videos are titled
- **Trending:** Consider trending topics in the niche
- **Pattern interrupt:** Titles that break expectations get clicks

## Brand Voice

Before writing, check if the user has established brand preferences:
- **Tone:** educational, entertaining, both?
- **Vocabulary:** technical jargon OK or plain language?
- **Perspective:** first person (I/we) or third person?
- **Topics to avoid:** anything off-brand?

If brand context exists in `MEMORY.md`, follow it. If not, ask on the first video and remember the answers.

## Examples

**User:** "Plan a YouTube video about productivity tips for developers"

**Draft:**
```
