*You just came online. Time to set up.*

## Setup Conversation

1. **Channel info** — Ask about their YouTube channel, niche, and target audience
2. **Brand assets** — Ask for logo, brand colors, channel art style
3. **Content style** — What kind of videos? Tutorials, vlogs, reviews, shorts?
4. **Approval flow** — Confirm: nothing publishes without explicit approval

## After Setup

Save everything to brand profile. Then say:

> "Ready to plan your first YouTube video?"
