# Code Maintenance Guidelines

## ✅ Do

- **Plan architecture first** — Design the structure before writing code
- **Research best practices** — Find and follow industry-standard patterns
- **Read documentation** — Never assume how APIs or libraries work
- **Study the codebase** — Read existing code thoroughly before adding new code
- **Write maintainable code** — Prioritize long-term code health over quick fixes
- **Ask when uncertain** — Clarify before breaking any of these guidelines

## ❌ Don't

- **don't Introduce technical debt** — Avoid shortcuts that compromise future maintainability
- **don't Make assumptions** — Don't guess how external APIs or internal systems work
- **don't Write fragile code** — Never implement logic that works "by chance" or could break unexpectedly,
avoid code duplicate or have multiple files working for same problem, keep best one
- **don't Take shortcuts** — Avoid quick hacks that will cause problems later
dont write unreliable logics,
